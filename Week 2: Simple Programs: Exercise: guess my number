#Exercise: guess my number

#In this problem, you'll create a program that guesses a secret number!

#The program works as follows: you (the user) thinks of an integer between 0 (inclusive) and 100 (not inclusive). 
#The computer makes guesses, and you give it input - is its guess too high or too low? Using bisection search, the computer
#will guess the user's secret number!

# ----------------Under line Code --------------------------------#

print("Please think of a number between 0 and 100!")
high = 100
low = 0
guessed = False
#Loop until we guess it correctly
while not guessed:
    #Bisection search
    guess = (high + low)//2
    print("Is your secret number " + str(guess)+ "?")
    user_inp = input("Enter 'h' to indicate the guess is too high. Enter 'l' to indicate the guess is too low. Enter 'c' to indicate I guessed correctly.")

    if user_inp == 'c':
        guessed = True
    elif user_inp == 'h':
        high = guess
    elif user_inp == 'l':
        low = guess
    else:
        print('Sorry, I did not understand your input.')

print('Game over.  Your secret number was: ' + str(guess))
